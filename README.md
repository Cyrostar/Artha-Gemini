2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Gemini API

You will need a Gemini API key to use the Artha-Gemini custom nodes. 
To get your API key, visit the Google AI Studio from the link below.

Once you have your API key, it's good practice to place it in the api.json 
file located in the ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Artha-Gemini folder.
Alternatively, you can enter it directly into the custom node's api_key field, 
but be aware that it will be visible in plain text.

You may also choose to define **GEMINI_API_KEY** as a global variable.
